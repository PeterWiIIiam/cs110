   ASSIGNMENT:      Project 8

   DATE:            Oct 29 2017

   DESCRIPTION:     In this game, we create a set of dice with varying sides and
                    put them randomly on two teams: vampires and zombies. The 
                    dice sit in a circular arrangement, so that each die has two
                    neighbors. On each game turn, all dice are rolled, and if 
                    any die's roll is less than a neighboring enemy's roll, that
                    die is converted to the other team.

                    The game continues until all dice belong to one team or all 
                    dice belong to one team!

                    The new changes are documented following:

                    User is able to create as many addtional teams other than 
                    the already existed Zombie and Vampire teams. The teams 
                    around the current team will compare their values and the 
                    team in the middle will change to the team of which the die
                    has the bigger value. 

                    For example, if the result of dice are 3,2,5, because‚àè the 
                    die on the right is bigger than the die on the left, the 
                    die in the middle would change to the team that die on the 
                    right belong to.

                    The game ends when all the dice belong to one team.
